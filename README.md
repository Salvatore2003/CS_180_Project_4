# CS_180_Project_4
This program runs a messaging system that connects buyers and sellers. These buyers and sellers will be able to message each other. The first step that the program takes
is to see if there are any accounts. The first account that is made is the admin account. The admin account main functionality is to shut down the program.
Once an admin is made the user can create a new user. They will be taken through a number of prompts to create their account. Once their account is created
they can sign in to their account. Once signed in to their account they are taken to a user interface. Here they can edit their settings, create a store, message people, or log out. 
If the user chooses to go to settings then they can edit everything within their account. This includes their username, password, email, and if they are a buyer and seller. They also have the ability
to completely delete their account. Deleting their account gets rid of their account information, and cannot be logged into again. Once the 
user edits the settings they will be taken to back to the user interface that allows them to choose to change their settings, messaging, and creating a store.
Once they are done the user will be able to sign out.
