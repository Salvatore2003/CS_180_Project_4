# CS_180_Project_4
This program runs a messaging system that connects users and sellers. These users and sellers will be able to message each other. The first step that the program takes
is see if there are any accounts. The first account that is made is the admin account. The admin account main functionality is to shut down the program from running.
Once an admin is made the user can create a new user. They will be taken through a number of prompts to create their account. Once their account is created
they can sign into their account. Once signed into their account they can edit their settings, create a store, or message people. If the user chooses to go to settings
then they can edit everything within their account. This includes their username, password, email, and if they are a buyer and seller. They also have the ablity
to completely delte their account. Deleting their account gets rid of their account information, and cannot be logged into again.
